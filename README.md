This code can be used to exatract the Detailed Schedule of the [AFS149 / TWS2019 conference](https://afstws2019.org/detailed-schedule/) and convert it to flat files so that you can easily see all of the talks that are happening at the same time, and plan your own conference schedule accordingly!

The results of this little project as a series of flat files can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6IrSt8uDWZSIk62Jm8FVDpLR2MVTxfiQAQ8f46HW7s/edit?usp=sharing

There are lots of things that could be done to improve this, from standardizing the time increments in the tables to building a Shiny app for easier navigation. But this was really just a way to practice and develop my web scraping skills. If you are eager to contribute or try something new, feel free to submit a PR!

Big thanks to @jonpye, @paleolimbot, @jonmcalder, @WilDoane, and @GrantHumphries for your insights about those tricky href elements! :)
